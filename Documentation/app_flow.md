Below is the complete app_flow.md document for the AI Video Editor project. This document integrates all clarifying details (derived from the 75 Q&A pairs) into the overall user flow. It serves as a comprehensive roadmap for both design and development teams, covering every interaction, state, decision, error handling, and integration point.

Application Flow Overview 

This document outlines the overall flow of the AI Video Editor mobile application. It details the user journey—from initial entry through processing and playback—and defines state transitions, decision points, error handling, and integration with external services. The goal is to ensure that every possible user interaction is accounted for and that the application behaves consistently and securely.

1. Purpose and Scope 

Purpose:
The app_flow.md file captures the complete user journey—from the initial interaction (such as landing on the app or logging in) to the final outcome (such as viewing an edited lecture video). It details the various application states, the triggers for transitions between these states, and the outcomes of those transitions.

Scope:
This document covers all aspects of user interaction, including entry points, state descriptions, decision points, error handling, feedback mechanisms, integration with external systems, navigation and redirection, session management, and security considerations. It is intended as a reference for both frontend and backend teams.

2. User Roles and Objectives 
	•	Student:
	•	Objectives: Access concise, topic-specific lecture segments; adjust playback settings; receive personalized content recommendations based on a watchtime algorithm and audience categorization.
	•	Teacher/Educator:
	•	Objectives: Upload and organize lecture videos with detailed metadata; utilize AI-powered transcription, segmentation, and SmartEdit commands (voice/text); review analytics to refine content.
	•	Admin/Support (if applicable):
	•	Objectives: Manage system configurations, user accounts, and oversee overall system performance.

3. User Entry Points 

Entry Points:
	1.	Landing Page:
	•	Description: The primary public interface where users (students, teachers, guests) arrive. Offers options to log in, register, or browse as a guest.
	•	Diagram Reference: See Diagram 1 below.
	2.	Login/Registration Pages:
	•	Description: Secure entry for registered users, with forms for email/password or social/SSO login.
	3.	API Endpoint (/api/start):

5. Decision Points and Branching 

This section describes conditional logic, decision points, and branching throughout the user flow.

5.1 Authentication Decision
	•	Condition:
	•	When a user attempts to log in or register.
	•	Branching:
	•	Valid Credentials: → Transition to Dashboard.
	•	Invalid Credentials: → Display error “Incorrect username or password” and allow retry.

5.2 Upload Validation
	•	Condition:
	•	During video selection and metadata entry.
	•	Branching:
	•	Valid File Format and Size: → Proceed to metadata entry.
	•	Invalid File: → Display error “Unsupported file format or file size exceeds limit” and prompt user to correct.
	•	Pre-upload Processing:
	•	If file exceeds size limits, trigger lightweight compression and notify the user.

5.3 Connectivity Decisions
	•	Condition:
	•	During upload or processing.
	•	Branching:
	•	Online: → Continue upload/processing.
	•	Offline: → Queue upload with “pending” status and automatically resume once connectivity is restored.

5.4 SmartEdit Command Decisions
	•	Condition:
	•	When a user issues a SmartEdit command.
	•	Branching:
	•	Command Recognized: → Execute the command and display real-time feedback.
	•	Command Unrecognized/Failure: → Display error message and offer an “undo” option.

5.5 User Query for Content Segmentation
	•	Condition:
	•	When a student enters a natural language query.
	•	Branching:
	•	Query Processed: → Convert to embedding vector and match transcript segments via cosine similarity.
	•	No Relevant Content Found: → Display “No matching content found” with options to refine the query.

6. Error Handling and Exceptions 

6.1 Common Error States
	•	Upload Errors:
	•	Network failures, unsupported file format, file size too large.
	•	Transcription Errors:
	•	Low confidence segments flagged for review.
	•	Processing Failures:
	•	Segment extraction issues, overlay insertion failures.
	•	Authentication Errors:
	•	Incorrect credentials, session timeouts.

6.2 Recovery and Fallback Mechanisms
	•	Automatic Retry:
	•	For connectivity issues, the app automatically retries uploads.
	•	Manual Review:
	•	Low-confidence transcript segments are flagged, and teachers can reprocess or edit them.
	•	Error Logging:
	•	Detailed logs are maintained to facilitate troubleshooting.
	•	User Notifications:
	•	Clear, actionable error messages (e.g., “Network error – upload will retry automatically”) are displayed to guide user action.

7. Feedback and Confirmation 

7.1 Feedback Mechanisms
	•	Confirmation Messages:
	•	Upon successful actions such as login, video upload, and SmartEdit command execution.
	•	Progress Indicators:
	•	Real-time progress bars and spinners during uploads and processing.
	•	Warnings and Alerts:
	•	Error messages for validation failures or connectivity issues.
	•	Undo Confirmation:
	•	Visual confirmation and availability of an “undo” button for SmartEdit commands.

8. Integration Points 

8.1 External APIs and Systems
	•	Google Cloud Speech-to-Text:
	•	Used for transcription; expected to return confidence scores for each segment.
	•	Cloud-based GPT/NLP Service:
	•	Processes natural language queries and SmartEdit commands.
	•	External Image APIs:
	•	Integrates with services such as Wikimedia Commons to fetch contextual images and diagrams.
	•	Text-to-Image Services:
	•	Optionally uses services like DALL-E or Stable Diffusion when external images are insufficient.

8.2 Error Handling for Integrations
	•	Expected Responses:
	•	Standardized API responses are processed, with errors triggering fallback mechanisms (e.g., manual review prompts).

9. Navigation and Redirection 

9.1 Navigation Guidelines
	•	Global Navigation:
	•	A bottom navigation bar allows users to quickly switch between the Library, Upload, Profile, and Settings screens.
	•	Redirection Logic:
	•	After successful login or registration, users are redirected to the Dashboard.
	•	Upon successful video upload, users are redirected to the processing screen.
	•	Browser back/forward actions are handled to ensure state consistency.
	•	Deep Linking:
	•	URLs or app links are mapped to specific states (e.g., a specific lecture’s playback screen).

10. User Session Management 

10.1 Session Initiation and Maintenance
	•	Login Process:
	•	Secure login via Firebase Authentication initiates a user session.
	•	Session Persistence:
	•	Sessions are maintained using token-based authentication with automatic renewal.
	•	Session Termination:
	•	Sessions are explicitly terminated upon logout, or automatically when inactive.

10.2 Session Expiration
	•	Interruption Handling:
	•	If a session expires or is interrupted, users are redirected to the login page with a notification.

11. Security Considerations 

11.1 Sensitive Transitions and Data
	•	Sensitive Operations:
	•	User authentication, metadata updates, and SmartEdit command processing.
	•	Data Security:
	•	All data transmissions use HTTPS. Role-based access via Firebase Security Rules ensures that only authorized users can access or modify sensitive information.
	•	Data Encryption:
	•	Sensitive data is encrypted both in transit and at rest, following modern encryption standards.
	•	Privacy:
	•	Analytics data is anonymized to comply with FERPA, GDPR, and other privacy regulations.

13. Formatting and Style Guidelines 
	•	Headings and Subheadings:
Use clear, descriptive headings (e.g., #, ##, ###) for each section.
	•	Lists:
Use bullet points or numbered lists for clear step-by-step instructions.
	•	Diagrams:
Embed diagrams using Mermaid syntax. Each diagram should have a caption and be referenced within the text.
	•	Code Blocks:
Use fenced code blocks for pseudo-code or technical examples, with annotations to explain key sections.
