This section integrates every detail from our clarifying Q&A. Each component is designed using modern techniques and standards to ensure the simplest, most reliable solution.
4.1 Mobile Video Upload & Metadata Management
Video Capture & File Specifications:
• Supported Formats:
The app will initially support MP4 and MOV formats. These formats are natively supported on iOS and widely used in educational settings. The architecture is modular, so additional formats can be integrated later using a modular codec framework (e.g., FFmpeg) and configurable validation rules.
• Maximum File Size:
The maximum upload size is set between 500 MB and 1 GB. This limit balances the need for high-quality recordings with mobile network and storage constraints. Techniques such as resumable uploads ensure reliability over variable network conditions.
• Pre-upload Processing:
Minimal pre-upload processing is recommended. The app will validate that the video file is in a supported format and within the allowed size. If the file exceeds the limits, a lightweight compression or transcoding step (using AVFoundation) will be triggered, ensuring compliance without unnecessary delays.
Offline Upload Handling:
• Upload Queue:
The app will implement an upload queue using local storage (via Core Data or a file cache) to persist pending uploads. This ensures that if the device is offline, uploads are stored and resumed automatically once connectivity is restored.
• Network Monitoring:
iOS’s Reachability APIs will continuously monitor network status, triggering automatic pausing and resumption of uploads as needed.
• Visual Feedback for Pending Uploads:
The UI will include clear icons or labels (e.g., a “pending” badge) and progress indicators to show that an upload is queued.
Metadata Management:
• Mandatory Fields:
Every video upload must include Title, Course Name, Lecture Date, and Instructor Name. These fields are validated on the client side (ensuring non-empty text and using a date picker for Lecture Date) for consistent, reliable organization.
• Optional Fields & Auto-Suggestions:
Additional metadata—such as Description, Tags, Keywords, and Summary—will be available. Auto-suggestions will be generated by referencing previous entries from Firestore or a local cache, standardizing entries and speeding up data entry.
• Post-Upload Editing and Versioning:
Teachers can edit metadata after upload. The system will track changes via versioning, allowing previous versions to be stored and rolled back if necessary.
• Linkage with Storage:
Videos are stored in Firebase Storage with a hierarchical structure:
/courses/{courseId}/lectures/{lectureId}/video.mp4
Each Firestore video document will contain a unique storagePath field to map directly to the file.
User Interface & Feedback:
• Upload Progress Indicators:
Real-time progress bars or spinners will update frequently (every few seconds or at key milestones such as 25%, 50%, 75%, 100%). These visual cues reassure users during the upload process.
• Error Handling:
If an upload fails due to connectivity issues, the app will automatically retry the upload and display clear error messages such as “Network error – upload will retry automatically,” with the option for manual retries if necessary.
4.2 Automated Transcription & Semantic Analysis
Transcription Engine Integration:
• ASR Service:
Google Cloud Speech-to-Text is selected for its proven track record, achieving over 95% word-level accuracy, low latency, and reliable performance in multi-speaker, noisy environments.
• Transcription Accuracy & Fallbacks:
The system’s target transcription accuracy is over 95%, verified during testing against benchmark transcripts. Confidence scores are monitored in real time; segments below the threshold will be flagged for manual review, and teachers will be notified.
Transcript Data Structure:
• JSON Schema:
Transcripts are stored in Firestore using a structured JSON format:

{
  "transcriptID": "unique_transcript_id",
  "videoID": "associated_video_id",
  "segments": [
    {
      "startTime": 0.0,
      "endTime": 5.5,
      "text": "Welcome to the lecture on...",
      "speaker": "Instructor",
      "confidence": 0.98
    }
  ],
  "language": "en",
  "generatedAt": "timestamp"
}

Each segment includes start time, end time, text, speaker (if applicable), and a confidence score for precise querying and processing.
Semantic Analysis & Query Mapping:
• NLP Techniques:
Modern NLP methods—such as transformer-based sentence embeddings, clustering (e.g., K-means), and cosine similarity—will analyze the transcript. These techniques help to group related segments, identify natural topic transitions, and remove duplicates.
• Mapping User Queries:
User queries are converted into embedding vectors (using models like Sentence-BERT). Cosine similarity is used to compare these vectors with transcript segment embeddings, ranking segments by relevance.
• Language Support:
The initial release will support English only, with plans for multi-language support in future updates once the core functionality is solid.
4.3 Video Splicing, Stitching, and Editing
Segment Extraction:
• AVFoundation Usage:
Videos are loaded as AVAsset objects, and AVAssetExportSession extracts segments using the provided start and end timestamps. Techniques to align cuts with keyframes—and interpolation if necessary—ensure frame-level precision.
• Handling Variable Video Properties:
The system is designed to handle different video resolutions and aspect ratios, ensuring that extracted segments are consistently high quality.
Seamless Stitching & Transitions:
• Concatenation Process:
Extracted segments are concatenated using AVMutableComposition. Transition effects such as fade-ins, cross-dissolves, and bridging slides are applied, with each transition lasting typically between 0.5 and 1 second for smooth visual continuity.
• Contextual Overlays:
When merging segments from different lectures, contextual overlays (e.g., title cards displaying lecture metadata) are dynamically generated using CoreGraphics. These overlays are then converted into video clips and inserted into the timeline using AVMutableComposition.
Audio Normalization:
• Normalization Techniques:
Audio normalization is managed using AVAudioMix with AVMutableAudioMixInputParameters to adjust gain and apply crossfades (recommended duration: 0.5–1 second). This approach ensures consistent audio levels across segments, with additional noise reduction applied when necessary.
Manual Review Interface:
• Preview & Adjustments:
A manual review interface allows teachers to preview the final edited video. Here, they can adjust segment boundaries, tweak transition durations, and modify overlays. This ensures that the automated process meets quality standards before final publication.
• Error Recovery:
If any part of the video processing pipeline fails (transcription, segmentation, overlay insertion), the system automatically retries or flags issues for manual review, supported by detailed error logging.
4.4 Contextual Enhancements & Visual Overlays
Image & Diagram Integration:
• External APIs:
The app will integrate with external APIs such as Wikimedia Commons to fetch high-quality images and diagrams that comply with resolution (e.g., HD quality) and licensing criteria (e.g., Creative Commons).
• Text-to-Image Generation:
When external imagery is insufficient or highly specific visuals are required, text-to-image generation services (such as DALL-E or Stable Diffusion) will be triggered. Generated images are then converted into overlay assets and integrated into the video timeline via AVMutableComposition.
Annotations & Overlays:
• Visual Design:
All on-screen annotations and chapter markers will follow a minimalistic, monochrome design that aligns with the app’s black-and-white theme. Simple fonts and subtle animations ensure that the annotations are clear without distracting from the video content.
• Interactive Annotations:
Annotations will be interactive, allowing users to tap and view additional information in pop-up overlays. Smooth interactions will be implemented using CoreAnimation.
• Synchronized Transcript Sidebar:
A toggleable transcript sidebar will auto-scroll in sync with video playback, highlight the current transcript line, and allow users to tap any line to jump to that specific timestamp.
4.5 SmartEdit Commands (Voice/Text-Activated)
Command Set & NLP Processing:
• Initial Command Set:
The initial SmartEdit commands include:
• “Remove awkward pause”
• “Enhance lighting”
• “Adjust audio levels”
• “Insert context image”
• “Trim beginning/end”
• “Undo last change”
• NLP Frameworks:
The app will use Apple’s Natural Language framework for on-device text processing, augmented by a cloud-based GPT model for more complex interpretations. This hybrid approach allows the system to accommodate varied phrasings and synonyms through pre-defined synonym dictionaries and transformer-based models.
• Voice Command Processing:
Voice commands are captured using the iOS Speech framework, converted to text, and then processed via the same NLP pipeline. The expected latency for voice commands is approximately 1–2 seconds.
Real-Time Feedback & Undo Functionality:
• Feedback Mechanisms:
Upon issuing a SmartEdit command, the UI will immediately show visual feedback—such as spinners, progress bars, and confirmation messages—indicating that the command is being processed.
• Undo Workflow:
An “undo” button will allow users to revert the most recent command. Initially, one level of undo is supported, with plans for multi-level undo in future releases via command history tracking in Firestore.
4.6 Personalized Playback & Analytics (Future Enhancements)
User Engagement Metrics:
• Metrics Collected:
The system will collect key engagement metrics such as watch time per segment, skip rates, and repeat views. These metrics will be aggregated using Firebase Analytics.
• Data Aggregation & Anonymization:
Data will be aggregated and anonymized (personally identifiable information will be removed or hashed) to comply with FERPA, GDPR, and other privacy standards.
Adaptive Playback & Recommendations:
• Recommendation Algorithm:
Initially, a heuristic algorithm based on watch time and skip rates will drive adaptive playback recommendations. In later versions, lightweight machine learning models (e.g., collaborative filtering) may be integrated.
• Audience Categorization:
The system will analyze previous search histories and view patterns to group users by similar interests using clustering techniques. These groupings will inform personalized content recommendations.
• Customization Options:
Students can adjust playback speed, toggle personalized recommendations on or off, and enable auto-pause during transcript reading. These settings will be available in a dedicated playback settings menu.
Analytics Dashboard:
• Visualization Techniques:
The analytics dashboard will present data using bar charts, line graphs, and pie charts. Tooltips and interactive filtering options will help teachers drill down into the data to derive actionable insights.
